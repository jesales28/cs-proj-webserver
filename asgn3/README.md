Description: README.md for asgn3

To compile my code, type: make
To run my code, type: ./httpserver -N *number of threads* -a *alias name* *server name* *port number*
Open a new tab to see client output and test on there.

Problems:
Program was only able to pass 2 of the test cases.
1) My logging does not work.
2) Dealing with a PATCH request is not fully finished.
2) My hash tables are not correctly implemented so my aliases do not get stored in the hash table.
