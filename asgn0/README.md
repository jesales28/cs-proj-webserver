Description: README.md for asgn0

To compile my code you type "gcc -o dog dog.c"
To run my code you can type "./dog ". However this will just take standard in like the cat function.
My code can print out standard input if no file is entered or if a "-" is detected as it's first argument.
My code can also print out the contents of .txt and .bin files.
As of right now. My code does not have any issues.
