Description: README.md for asgn0

To compile my code you type "make"
To run my code you can type "./dog *some_file_name(s)_or_dash".
My code can print out standard input if no file is entered or
if a "-" is detected as it's first argument.My code can also 
print out the contents of .txt and .bin files.
As of right now. My code cannot print out large files.
I also did not write down the logic for figuring out these issues.
